# Working
Noise Removal with morphological approach
In this part we define a 5 by 5 kernal using np array. Then dilation and erosion is done by using a predefined functions dilate() and erode() in OpenCV library. For Opening and closing a functoin called morphologyEX() by changing its attributes.

# Run the code
